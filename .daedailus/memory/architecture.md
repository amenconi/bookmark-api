# Architecture

## Overview
Express.js REST API with layered architecture using Prisma ORM for database operations and TypeScript for type safety. Follows separation of concerns with dedicated layers for configuration, middleware, routing, and utilities.

## Core Components
- **Express Server**: HTTP server handling REST API endpoints
- **Prisma ORM**: Database abstraction layer for SQLite operations
- **Configuration Layer**: Environment and Express app configuration
- **Middleware**: Error handling and request processing
- **Routes**: API endpoint definitions and handlers
- **Models**: Data models generated by Prisma
- **Utils**: Shared utility functions

## Data Flow
1. HTTP requests enter through Express routes
2. Requests processed by middleware (error handling, CORS)
3. Route handlers validate input and call Prisma operations
4. Prisma client interacts with SQLite database
5. Responses formatted and returned through Express

## Key Patterns
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between config, middleware, routes, models
- **ORM Pattern**: Prisma handles database abstraction
- **Middleware Pipeline**: Express middleware for cross-cutting concerns

## File Structure
```
/src
  /config     # Environment and Express configuration
  /middleware # Request processing middleware
  /routes     # API endpoint definitions
  /models     # Prisma-generated data models
  /utils      # Shared utility functions
  /generated  # Prisma client generation output
  index.ts    # Application entry point
```

## Integration Points
- **External**: SQLite database file system storage
- **Internal**: Prisma client for database operations, Express for HTTP handling
